# 3.3 Tuple Basics
**tuple:**
A tuple, usually pronounced "tuhple" or "toople," stores a collection of data, like a list, but is immutable â€“ once created, the tuple's elements cannot be changed.  

!!! note "tuples"

    Treat tuples as a list that cannot be changed. This is useful if you want to hard code global values for everyone to use.  
    Ex. A calendar, week day names, categories, etc.  

**named tuple:**
Named tuple allows the programmer to define a new simple data type that consists of named attributes.  

!!! note "Named Tuples"
 
    This is new to python, you won't really need to use this for our class. I don't have a real use case for named tuples in data analytics.  
    Just be aware it's possible to create attributes and data types.  
    You can create attributes with class, which is more likely to be used.

    In order to create a named tuple, you have to use an import.  
    ```
    # Imports namedtuple function in order to create a named tuple
    from collections import namedtuple

    # Create an object that hold tuple attributes
    wizard = namedtuple('wizard', ['wizard_name', 'power_level', 'wand'])

    # Create an object and assign these attributes to a variable
    harry_potter = wizard('Harry Potter', 1000, 'dragon')

    # Show attributes
    print(harry_potter)
    ```

    Output: `wizard(wizard_name='Harry Potter', power_level=1000, wand='dragon')`
