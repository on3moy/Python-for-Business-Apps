## 1.1 Programming (general)  
**Input**:
Receives data  
**Process**:
Performs computations on that data  
**Output**:
Program puts that data somewhere. 

"Programs use variables to refer to data, like x, y, and z below. The name is due to a variable's value "varying" as a program assigns a variable like x with new values."  

There are a sequence of steps and an order a program must follow. Like when reading a book, you open the book a certain way depending on your region and you start to read words from left to right ingest sentences as you read from top to bottom. You can say there is an order of operations here.  

## 1.2 Programming using Python  
**Python Interpreter**:
Program that executes code written in the python programming language.  
??? Example
    I started my Python Interpreter using windows CMD/PowerShell with below snippit.  
    (Python should start up if PATH variables were setup on installation.)  

    ```
    python
    print('Hello World!')
    ```

**Interactive Interpreter:**
Program that allows to execute one line of code at a time.  

**Code**:
Code is a common word for the textual representation of a program (and hence programming is also called coding).  

**Line**:
Row of text.  

**Prompt**:
">>>", this indicates the interpreter is ready to accept code.  

**Statement**:
A statement is a program instruction.  

**Expressions**:
Expressions are code that return a value when evaluated; for example, the code wage * hours * weeks is an expression that computes a number.  
```
wage = 20
hours = 8
print(wage * hours)
```

**Variables**:
The names wage, hours, weeks, and salary are variables, which are named references to values stored by the interpreter.  

**Assignment**:
A new variable is created by performing an assignment using the = symbol.  

**print()**:
Print() function displays variables or expression values.

**Comments**:
Characters such as "#" denote comments, which are optional but can be used to explain portions of code to a human reader.  

```
# See <-- HashtagComment, subscribe and slam the bell icon, It means the interpreter will ignore this line of code. Write all the notes within the same line. If you make the person scroll to read, its already too long. Please create another comment line.
storeThisValue = 13
itDoesntMatterWhatYouCallMe = '13'
butItKindOfDoes = ':)'  
```
