# 2.11 Representing Text
**Unicode:**
String variables to represent text.  

**Code Point:**
Character with a unique number

## Unicode  
We can get the textual representation of a number by using Python's built-in function **chr()**.  
chr() will convert the number to a string character. You can copy and past below to get all characters from numbers 32-127.  

??? example "ðŸ¦– Unicode Conversation Example"  

    ```
    for num in range(32,127):
        char_converted = chr(num)
        print(f'{num}: {char_converted}')
    ```  

    ```
    # Sample Output
    32:  
    33: !
    34: "
    35: #
    36: $
    37: %
    ```  
    Convert these character back to numbers using ord()!!!  

## Escape Sequences
Special characters exist to do some sort of operation

The `\` backslash tells python, don't read the next character as a string, instead do some operation.  

```
# Using a n in combination with the escape sequence creates a new line  
print('Hello, this is the first line\nThis is the second line')
```

|Escape Sequence|Explanation|Example code|Output|  
|---------------|-----------|------------|------|  
|\\\\|Backslash (\\)|print('\\\\home\\\\users\\\\')|print('\\home\\users\\')|  
|\\|Single quote (')|print('Name: John O\\'Donald')|Name: John O'Donald|  
|\\|Double quote (")|print("He said, \"Hello friend!\"")|He said, "Hello friend!"|  
|\\n|Newline|print('My name...\nIs John...')|My name...|  
|-|-|-|Is John...|   

```
# Tab example
print('hola')
print('/tHi I am corgi')
```

Output:
```
hola
    Hi I am corgi
```

# Raw Strings
Ignore backslashes or escape sequence by starting the string with an "r". 

```
my_string = 'This is a \n \'normal\' string\n'
my_raw_string = r'This is a \n \'raw\' string'
```  

- You can concatenate a string adding two strings with a "+"
