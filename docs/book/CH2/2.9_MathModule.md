# Math Module
Python has a built in `math` module for advanced math operations.  

```
import math

num = 144
sqrt_num = math.sqrt(num)
print(sqrt_num)
```

!!! abstract "functions"

    sqrt(), print(), sum(), etc. are functions.  
    function:
    List of statements that can be executed by simply referring to the functions name.  
    
    - The analogy would be similar to creating a script and assigning to a variable to reuse. 

??? question "How do you know if its a function?"

    If everyone is able to create functions and share, how do we get a list of all of these functions?  
    We don't. We can only get a list of python's built in functions with below script. 

    ```
    import builtins
    print(dir(builtins))
    ```

    For all other functions, once we import the library, we can get the list of all functions like below.  
    dir() is a built in function that shows attributes of an object.  

    - VSCode IntelliSense will be able to tell you if its a function with dot notation.  
    ```
    # This will print all the available functions, classes, and variables within SomeModuleName
    import SomeModuleName
    print(dir(SomeModuleName))
    ```
