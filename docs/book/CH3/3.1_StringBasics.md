# String Basics
**string:**
A string is a sequence of characters, like the text MARY, that can be stored in a variable.  

**string literal:**
A string literal is a string value specified in the source code of a program.  

**sequence type:**
Sequence type: A type that specifies a collection of objects ordered from left to right.

!!! info "len()"

    Python Built in function to find the length of a string (How many characters are within the string?).  

    Input: `len('moy')`  
    Output: `3`

## Brackets / Slicing

When you use `[]`, you are saying I want to cut this string a certain way using indexes.  
- Note that the index will always start with 0

??? example "ðŸ¦– Example"  

    Let's use `'wowmom'` as an example. 

    Grab the first letter
    `'wowmom'[0]`    

    Grab wow  
    `'wowmom'[:3]`  

    Grab mom  
    `'wowmom'[3:7]` or `'wowmom'[3:]`  

    - Notice I am not doing `'wowmom'[:2]`  to grab wow
    - This is because when slicing within a range using the ":", the last number in the range is minus 1  
    - Meaning, if I want to get indexes 0-5, I have to slice like so `[:6]` ([:6 - 1])

## Changing String Variables
Strings are immutable and cannot be changed  
```
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

# Change to upper case

alphabet[0] = 'A'  # Invalid: Cannot change character
alphabet[1] = 'B'  # Invalid: Cannot change character

print('Alphabet:', alphabet)
```
