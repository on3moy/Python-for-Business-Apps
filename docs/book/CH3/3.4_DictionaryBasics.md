# 3.4 Dictionary Basics
Dictionaries are versatile and highly used in my data analytics experience! Get to know how to use dictionaries!  

??? info "Use cases"

    You will most likely work with JSON files. You can convert these into dictionaries to further parse out the information.  
    
    1. You might need to get data from an API call that comes in JSON format and create a table.
    2. You might need to work with IoT Telemetry data that outputs only key value pairs and create tables.
    3. It might be easier to convert outputs from legacy systems into JSON to work with.

    All this to say, dictionaries are your go to for working with pandas, spark tables, and anything database related.

!!! note "Fun Fact"

    When I learned Python, dictionaries were not able to store data in an ordered format. Meaning, the order in which you stored data would move around ðŸ¥².  

    This is no longer true. With Python's updates, Dictionaries **now hold the order in which they were entered!** Good for tables and reports.  

**dictionary:**
A dictionary is a Python container used to describe associative relationships.

**dict:**
A dictionary is represented by the dict object type.  

**key:**
A key is a term that can be located in a dictionary, such as the word "cat" in the English dictionary.  

**value:**
A value describes some data associated with a key, such as a definition.  

**curly braces / key:value pairs:**
A dict object is created using curly braces { } to surround the key:value pairs that comprise the dictionary contents.  

!!! warning "Do not confuse yourself with sets"

    `set()` also has `{}` as
