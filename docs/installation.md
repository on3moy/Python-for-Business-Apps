    Apologies in advance. This class will mainly focus on window systems, however I will provide all the documentation
    necessary for you to use MacOS & Linux.

## ü™ü Windows
Head over to python's website to download the latest version of python.

    If you are a rebel, you can download an older version if you have other dependencies. (If you know what you are doing)
1. Install with default settings

## ü¶ñ Preferred IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  

This class will use VSCode as the default IDE.  
You may choose to use any IDE you want.

### Once VSCode is installed, you need to install 2 Extensions within VS Code

- Python (Allows you to code using Python Syntax)
- Jupyter (Allows you to code in notebook formats)

## üíª Command Line Interface (CLI)
We use CLI to communicate and interact with the OS without using any **GUI**(1).
{ .annotate }  

1. Graphical User Interface  

For Windows, PowerShell is newer, meant to replace CMD, and offers more capabilities.  
- You can use which ever you want.

For Mac OS, Terminal, Zsh, or Bash would be your CLI.
