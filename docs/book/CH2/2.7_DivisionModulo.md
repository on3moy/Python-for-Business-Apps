# 2.7 Division & Modulo  
## Division  
Division returns a float. Even if you divide two integers and there isn't a remainder, you still get a float returned.  
Input:
`4 / 2`  
Output:
`2.0`

## Floor Division
**Floor division:**
Used to round down the result of a float to the smallest whole number value. (Returns an integer)  
Noted as two back slashes `//`  

Input:
`5 // 3`(1)  
Output:
`1`  
{ .annotate }  

1. 5 / 3 approximately is 1.6667, lowest integer is 1

**The Modulo Operator:**
Evaluates the remainder of the division.  
Noted as `%`  

Input:
`5 % 3`(1)  
Output:
`2`
