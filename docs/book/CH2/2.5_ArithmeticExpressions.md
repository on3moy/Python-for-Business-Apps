## Basics
Python can do all the basic operations a calculator can do, and more.  

!!! quote "Zybooks"  

    **expression:** 
    is a combination of items, like variables, literals, operators, and parentheses, that evaluates to a value, like 2 * (x + 1).  

    - A common place where expressions are used is on the right side of an assignment statement, as in y = 2 * (x + 1).  

    **literal:** 
    is a specific value in code like 2. An operator is a symbol that performs a built-in calculation, like +, which performs addition. Common programming operators are shown below.  

|Arithmetic operator|Description|  
|--|--|  
|+|The addition operator is +, as in x + y.|  
|-|The subtraction operator is -, as in x - y. Also, the - operator is for negation, as in -x + y, or x + -y.|  
|*|The multiplication operator is *, as in x * y.|  
|/|The division operator is /, as in x / y.|  
|**|The exponent operator is **, as in x ** y (x to the power of y).|  

## Evaluation of Expressions
Remember **Order of Operations** or  **precedence rules** in Algebra?  
This is very similar.  

|Operator/Convention|Description|Explanation|  
|--|--|--|  
|( )|Items within parentheses are evaluated first.|In 2 * (x + 1), the x + 1 is evaluated first, with the result then multiplied by 2.|  
|exponent **|** used for exponent is next.|In x**y * 3, x to the power of y is computed first, with the results then multiplied by 3.|  
|unary -|- used for negation (unary minus) is next.|In 2 * -x, the -x is computed first, with the result then multiplied by 2.|  
|* / %|Next to be evaluated are *, /, and %, having equal precedence.|(% is discussed elsewhere.)|  
|+ -|Finally come + and - with equal precedence.|In y = 3 + 2 * x, the 2 * x is evaluated first, with the result then added to 3, because * |has higher precedence than +. Spacing doesn't matter because y = 3+2 * x would still evaluate 2 * x first.|  
|left-to-right|If more than one operator of equal precedence could be evaluated, evaluation occurs left to right. Note: The ** operator is evaluated from right-to-left.|In y = x * 2 / 3, the x * 2 is first evaluated, with the result then divided by 3.|
