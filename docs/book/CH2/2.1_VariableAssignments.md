# 2.1 Variables and assignments  
## Variables  
We finally get to the beauty of what Python, an **OOP**(1) can do!

1. [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)

**Variable:**
Named item, such as x, y, john, lamp.  

**Assignment Statement:**
We assign variables with the equal sign "=".  

```
x = 13 ✅
JohnDoe = 55 ✅  
```

We have to follow certain rules to assign a variable  
1. The variable always starts on the left, then =, then your object/value.  
    `5 = x` ❌  
2. The only way to assign something to a variable is by using =  
    `x => 5` ❌  
3. Must start with a letter  
    `1x = 5`  ❌

5. [Names to Avoid](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#names-to-avoid)  

## Naming Styles
[PEP 8 Documentation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles)  

- b (single lowercase letter)
- B (single uppercase letter)
- lowercase
- lower_case_with_underscores
- UPPERCASE
- UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- CapitalizedWords (or CapWords, or CamelCase – so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4]). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps.
- mixedCase (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase character!) ⚠️ (Try not to use, unless its already common within scripts)
- Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores (ugly!) ❌ ❌ ❌   

!!! note "Note"
    
    When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the acronym. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.
