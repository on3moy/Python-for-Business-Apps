# 2.2 Identifiers  
!!! quote "Zybooks"  

    **identifier / name / underscores:**
    An identifier, also called a name, is a sequence of letters (a-z, A-Z), underscores (_), and digits (0–9), and must start with a letter or an underscore.  

    **case sensitive:**
    Python is case sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters differ. Ex: "Cat" and "cat" are different.  

    **Reserved words / keywords:**
    Reserved words, or keywords, are words that are part of the language and cannot be used as a programmer-defined name.  

    **PEP 8:**
    PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal) outlines the basics of how to write Python code neatly and consistently.

!!! tip "Reserved Words"

    Python reserves certain words to work. Example, **sum** is a word reserved to add numbers. You don't want to override this function. **print** is another word you don't want to use.  
    `print = 13` ❌  
    `sum =  13 + 23` ❌  

??? question "How can we know which words not to use?"

    For now just copy and paste below code in a cell to see the full list.  

    - We can discuss what it all does a little later.  

    ```
    # Import some built in python libraries to get reserved words
    import keyword
    import builtins

    # Assign the list to a variable
    keyword_list = keyword.kwlist
    builtin_list = dir(builtins)

    # Add the two different lists together
    reserved_words = keyword_list + builtin_list

    # Show the output
    print(f'Number of words to avoid: {len(reserved_words)}')
    print(reserved_words)
    ```
