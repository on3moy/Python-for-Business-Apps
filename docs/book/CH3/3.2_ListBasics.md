# 3.2 List Basics
**container**:
A container is a construct used to group related values together and contains references to other objects instead of data.  

**list:**
A list is a container created by surrounding a sequence of variables or literals with brackets [ ].  

??? info "lists"

    [something, integer, maybe a string, float?, more things]  
    `hey_you = 15`  
    `[13.0, '13', 'hi', hey_you]`   

**element:**
A list item is called an element.  

**index:**
Elements are ordered by position in the list, known as the element's index, starting with 0.  

!!! note "index example"  

    `[13.0, '13', 'hi', hey_you]`  
    The index output of above items are..  
    `[0, 1, 2, 3]`  
    index of 4 is? Error, we only have 4 items and we start at 0. Index of 4 says we have at least 5 elements.  
    index of 3 is? `hey_you` variable!  

**method:**
A method instructs an object to perform some action, and is executed by specifying the method name following a "." symbol and an object.  

!!! example "method example"

    For our strings example, python allows us to perform actions, like a split.  
    `'a string of something'.split()`  
    
    Or below syntax.

    ```
    my_string = 'a string os something'
    
    # We store the split string into a variable. Split return a list of strings
    string_list = my_string.split()
    ```

**append():**
The append() list method is used to add new elements to a list.  

!!! example "append() example"

    Below works as well, why use append?
    ```
    x = [1, 2]
    y = [3, 4]

    added_list = x + y
    ```

    With append, we actually change the list in place, which means we don't have to assign the added lists to a new variable!  
    ```
    x = [1, 2]
    y = [3, 4]

    # Lets change the list within the x variable
    # Notice, we can only append one element at a time
    x.append(3)
    x.append(4)
    ```  
    Output of x: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`  

    We didn't need to do an new assignment!  

**pop() / remove():**
Elements can be removed using the pop() or remove() methods.  

!!! abstract "pop()"

    pop() by default removes the last element in the list.  

    - You can be specific and remove an element from the list utilizing the index position.  
    - `pop[0]` will eliminate the first element and also grabs the eliminated element.  

    Let's store the popped value into a variable like below.
    ```
    somelist = ['hi', 13, 'Friday']  
    extract_last_element = somelist.pop()  
    print(somelist)  
    print(extract_last_element)  
    ```
    Output:
    ```
    ['hi',13]
    'Friday'
    ```

with `remove()`, you can remove the actual name of the element instead of using indexes.  
```
somelist.remove('hi')
print(somelist)
```

Output: `[13, 'Friday']`  

## Modify the lists
Use slicing to modify an element within the list

!!! abstract "modify"

    ```
    list_a = [13, 14, 15]
    list_a[0] = 'WOW'
    print(list_a)
    ```
    You can see the 13 if poof, no longer.  
    Output: `['WOW', 14, 15]`  

## Sequence type functions
You can also do many neat things to lists. Similar to a column in excel.  

|Operation|Description|  
|---------|-----------|  
|len(list)|Find the length of the list.|  
|list1 + list2|Produce a new list by concatenating list2 to the end of list1.|  
|min(list)|Find the element in the list with the smallest value. All elements must be of the same type.|  
|max(list)|Find the element in the list with the largest value. All elements must be of the same type.|  
|sum(list)|Find the sum of all elements of a list (numbers only).|  
|list.index(val)|Find the index of the first element in the list whose value matches val.|  
|list.count(val)|Count the number of occurrences of the value val in the list.|
