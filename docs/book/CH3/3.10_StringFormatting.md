# String Formatting

You can use the .format method (Which is the old method).  

Or you can use the f string method, which is more intuitive and easier to read.  

`f'this is an fstring, because there is an f before single quotes'`  

??? question "Why use this?"

    To bring in data into a string! Or to dynamically create strings!  
    
    - To create an email template and auto fill the name, subject, and some portion of the body?  
    - To print variables with some details?  
    `print(f'I am {years_variable} old.')`  
    - So many more use cases, get comfortable using f strings!  

!!! example "Example"

    ```
    # Create variables with text
    student = 'John Doe'
    color = 'purple'

    # The old way of formatting using {} and format method
    print('Hi my name is {}. {} is my favorite color'.format(student, color))

    # The new way, use this. You can see its more intuitive and easy to follow
    print(f'Hi my name is {student}. {color} is my favorite color')

    # Did you notice the only way to bring in data into a string is by using {}?
    ```
