# 2.6 Python Expressions  
Best shown by example...  

```
""" Computes the total cost of leasing a car given the down payment,
    monthly rate, and number of months """

down_payment = int(input('Enter down payment: '))
payment_per_month = int(input('Enter monthly payment: '))
num_months = int(input('Enter number of months: '))

total_cost = down_payment + (payment_per_month * num_months) # ⬅️ The expression

print (f'Total cost: ${total_cost:.2f}')
```  

!!! note "Operator Styling"  

    Put a single space between operators.  
    `5 + 5`

??? example "Good practices"  

    [PEP 8 Styles](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#should-a-line-break-before-or-after-a-binary-operator)  

    ```
    # Correct:
    # easy to match operators with operands
    income = (gross_wages
        + taxable_interest
        + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
        - ira_deduction
        - student_loan_interest)
    ```  

    [Other PEP 8 Recommendations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#other-recommendations)
    ```
    # Correct:
    i = i + 1
    submitted += 1
    x = x*2 - 1
    hypot2 = x*x + y*y
    c = (a+b) * (a-b)
    ```  

## Compound Operators
Just another way to short hand some code.  
Look at the third column and see how its written.(1)  
{ .annotate } 

1. Normally you write in this format to understand the concept. Once you get comfortable, use compound operator version.   

|Compound operator|Expression with compound operator|Equivalent expression|  
|--|--|--|  
|Addition assignment|age += 1|age = age + 1|  
|Subtraction assignment|age -= 1|age = age - 1|  
|Multiplication assignment|age *= 1|age = age * 1|  
|Division assignment|age /= 1|age = age / 1|  
|Modulo (operator discussed elsewhere) assignment|age %= 1|age = age % 1|
